## Standard equations

The standard extraction equations are simple and useful for comparing results with others.

For percolation, the equation is <InlineMath>{'EY =\\frac{CB}{D}'}</InlineMath> and for immersion it is <InlineMath>{'EY=\\frac{CW}{D}'}</InlineMath>.

## Immersion

<BlockMath>{'EY =\\frac{C}{1-C}(\\frac{W}{D}-f_{abs})'}</BlockMath>

## Percolation

<BlockMath>
  {
    'EY=\\frac{C_{beverage}-C_{slurry}}{1-C_{slurry}}\\cdot\\frac{B}{D}+\\frac{C_{slurry}}{1-C_{slurry}}(\\frac{W}{D}-f_{abs})'
  }
</BlockMath>

This calculator currently uses the LRR, <InlineMath>{'\\frac{W-B}{D}'}</InlineMath> as an estimate for <InlineMath>{'f\_{abs}'}</InlineMath>.
