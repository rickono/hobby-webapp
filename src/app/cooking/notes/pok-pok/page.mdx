## Four big regions for Thai food

### Northern Thailand

Lots of rivers, mountains, and forests with a cool climate. Distinct cuisine reflecting the climate and mix of ethnicities: Lao, Burnese, Shan, Jin Haw of Southern China, and indigenous tribes like the Hmong, Karen, and others. Chiang Mai, the major city was under Burmese control until the late 18th centiry, independent until the late 19th, and then remote for decades.

The rice is sticky. Generous use of dried spices, frequent fresh turmeric, prevalent bitterness from leaves, shoots, and spices like _makhwen_ and occasionally beef bile. Tendency towards tamarind over lime. Fermented soy beans in disks called _tua nao_ rather than fish sauce and shrimp paste was used traditionally, but now all three are used. Mildest heat of the four regions.

Iconic dishes are: Boiled curries like Jin Hoom, Kaeng Khanun. Relish like Naam Phrik Num. Grilled meat. Laap Meuang, very different from the Laap of Isaan.
