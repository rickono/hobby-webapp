## Yam Tuna 

Not long ago I was at a Thai friend's house for dinner. He employed a fantastic Isaan cook, who brought out dish after awesome dish, including one that would become a favorite of mine. It looked like a typical _yam_, what we translate into English as "salad," except that the main ingredient looked a lot like canned tuna.

_Can't be_, I thought. In Thailand, your mind often plays tricks on you. What looks like beef could very well be water buffalo. What you assume is green papaya turns out to be white turmeric. I took a bite. No question, it was canned tuna. And it was fucking delicious.

Once I'd eaten it, I started seeing how common canned fish is in Thai food. This is one of those weird and wonderful dishes that are testaments to the fact that Thai cooks can take just about any ingredient you give them and seamlessly incorporate it into their culinary lexicon. It proves yet again that modern Thai food is fusion food, in the best sense of the term.

While tuna isn't a particularly popular fish in Thailand, the country happens to be a major exporter of the canned stuff. I still don't know whether the fish has its roots as a _yam_ made with fresh fish or witha creative and convenience-oriented young cook who was trying to make dinner on the cheap and thought, _Hey, why not?_

Back in Portland, I put it on Pok Pok's menu as a special, thinking customers would get a kick out of an offbeat combination. Now, it's a staple there. Typically, I look to local canneries that process tasty local albacore caught off the coast. But when I come across great fresh albacore, I grill it and use that instead. You should do the same.
