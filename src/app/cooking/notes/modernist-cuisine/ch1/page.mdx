## The origins of cooking

- Necessity, rather than taste drove early cooking and food preparation: Native American tribes had a procedure to make acorns edible, native people in Peru, Colombia, and Venezuela figured out a way to remove cyanide from cassava.
- Agriculture was a turning point where people were fed more reliably, but a crop failure meant famine and death so it wasn't all easy. Early agricultural societies also had large vitamin deficiencies. But farming eventually became more productive than hunting and gathering.
- Agriculture also made food choices limited and diet boring, so a new motivation for cooking, improving the taste and variety of food, was born.
- As people could settle down, all aspects of human culture flourished, including writing, religion, politics, and food.
- Archaeological remains from Egypt 5000 years ago show that they already had food related professions including bakers, butchers, brewers, and winemakers. Professionals often differed quite a bit in cooking than home cooks- for example baking leavened bread was a professional activity. People didn't have ovens in their homes and when they did, it was not cost effective to heat it to bake one loaf of bread. Flatbread however didn't require an oven and people made it at home and became a part of peasant cuisine around the world, from tortillas in Mexico to _chapati_ in India and _lefse_ in Norway.
- Professional cooking jobs had several reasons for flourishing, including expensive equipment, the skill required, and affluent customers that were willing to pay. Wealth was synonymous with political or religious power, so employers of professional chefs were kings, aristocrats, and priests.
- The divide between professional cooking and peasant home cooking drove each other. Professional cooks strove to do things differently from the masses and common people strove to adopt professional techniques that they could.
- Countries with long histories and stable aristocracies and ruling classes developed the most complex cuisines. France is a good example, where it is dominated by aristocratic food. France reached renown in cooking very early.
- Chinese food was also aristocratically driven. The variety of Chinese dishes stems from the imperial court, which governed China for more than 1000 years.
- Far northern or southern cuisines don't have the variety of dishes that equatorial regions do. England had an elaborate monarchy that ruled for a thousand years, but geography, resulting in less varied ingredients, made development of sophisticated cuisine hard. Viking kings of Scandinavia and tsars of Russia fall into the same category, and all of them imported French chefs.
- This is a simplified view.
  - Spain had a long-standing monarchy and aristocracy that accumulated lots of wealth by exploiting the New World, but Spanish cuisine is more driven by farm and peasant life. In Andalusia however cuisine from the Islamic courts made a lasting contribution.
  - German traditional foods mostly come from the peasant table, like sausages and ham. Germany never had a long-standing large aristocracy, and it was only unified as a country in the late 19th century. Germany also suffered by its limited diversity of indigenous fruits, vegetables, and herbs.
- Italy is a great example of political fragmentation affecting cuisine. They have a great climate for diversity. They weren't unified as a country until 1870, and until then there was no centralized monarchy and no royal court for chefs to create dishes. They developed distinct foods for the one permanent fixture, the Papacy, but it wasn't to the same sort of cuisine as France or China. Italy was the birthplace of the Renaissance. The heart of Italian cooking is in the farms and people who cultivate it. Italy did have a central political authority in Roman times. Roman food was passed down in the ancient cookbook _Apicius_. Roman is not the same as Italian, though. A key condiment was garum, which they added to everything. They used lovage, cumin, coriander which are almost never found in Italian cuisine today. Basil is only mentioned once in Apicius and garlic rarely.
- Early English cookbooks found that 40% of savory dishes contained cinnamon. The flavor profile was more similar to that of Indian or Thai food today. Only a few relics remain of this, like gingerbread and cardamom breads in Scandinavia.
- Greek food is largely based in peasant food, but has remnants of Turkish influence from the Ottoman empire. There are few similarities today of sophisticated ancient Greek cooking.
- The foods of most empires did not survive. Homer records lots of feasts in the _Odyssey_ and _Iliad_ but no recipes. Egyptian cooks in pharaohs' courts didn't record recipes, yet they invented foie gras- what else did they make? The Mayans also probably had great cuisine, with major discoveries in math and astronomy- they worshipped chocolate.

## Evolution and Revolution

### The myth of tradition 

- The people who advocate for tradition, "old ways are best", and more interested in grandma's recipe than a contemporary chef's latest creations, have a view that's only possible if you shut your eyes to history.
- Italian cuisine is a great example, where it is one of the most popular cuisines worldwide, traditionalists see it as deeply authentic. But almost all modern cuisine is based off of ingredients outside of Italy.
  - Pasta is based off noodles in China predating Italians by 3,000 years. Recent studies suggest Arab traders brought pasta to Muslim Sicily a few centuries before Marco Polo made his trip in the 13th century, which was another theory.
  - Mozzarella di bufala is Italian, but water buffaloes are from Southeast Asia. Tomatoes are from the Americas, and so is corn and chocolate. Potatoes in gnocchi are from South America, and so are hot peppers. Rice, now used in risotto is from Asia, eggplants from India, carrots from Afganistan, and almonds from the Middle East.
  - Espresso as a technique is Italian, but coffee beans were imported from the Arabian penninsula.
  - Even if you managed to make a menu with only Italian ingredients, they'd be nothing like the medieval Italian and ancient Roman cuisine that predated it.
- The pattern holds in less prosperous societies, like subsistence-farming communities in Africa, where they make cassava and corn, both from South America. Others from Africa include bananas from Southeast Asia or peanuts, sweetpotatoes, and beans from South America. The only natively African plants are millet, sorghum, and okra.
- Imported ingredients sometimes take a while to catch on. The kiwi was introduced to England in 1953 and the US in 1962. Today, kiwifruit is found in pretty much every grocery store and likely will be considered part of traditional American dishes at some point. The kiwifruit didn't actually even originate from New Zealand but from China.
- Michael Pollan says to not eat ingredients that our grandparents wouldn't recognize- seems like sound advice with the advent of junk food, but it doesn't take that many generations to completely erase traditional food.
  - History of food tells us that health has shaped adoption throughout history. Tomatoes were considered poisonous at first in Europe, as they were part of the nightshade family and kept out of many European diets for a century or more. Potatoes also suffered from suspicion.

### True Revolution

- While gradual change is the norm there's sometimes revolutionary movements. Look at Impressionism which blazed the trail for modern art and went against the strict and formulaic rules of the time. Today it is central to our definition of art.
- Cuisine has unusually few big movements and revolutions. France has been subject to many revisions. Antonin Carême documented French cuisine in a series of books, culminating in _L'Art de la Cuisine Française_. Auguste Escoffier became the natural successor to Carême, and his _Le Guide Culinaire_ published in 1903 served as the definitive manual for classic French cuisine. 
- Escoffier spent lots of his time outside of France, and worked with César Ritz to create the Savoy Hotel in London and the Ritz hotels. Compared to the Carême era, sophisticated cooking was now more democratic. There was innovation and cuisine changed but there wasn't a revolution.

### Revolution at the Low England

- Gastronomy is usually told from the perspective of the high end and even the peasant story is that of well fed peasants who grew their own food. The late 20th century saw a revolution in the masses. The newly minted middle class needed to eat, with disposable income but no time. City dwellers didn't have gardens and farms nearby. Adult women were more likely to have a job. They didn't have the time, skills, or help to cook but they did have money to eat well.
- A new type of food company rose to fill this need. In 1900 Coca-Cola introduced premixed sodas that were very different from home beverages. Yogurt followed, a popular product in Greece, Bulgaria, and Turkey. Dannon operated at a loss until they changed to add strawberry jam to the bottom and Americans embraced the new sweet flavors. Jay Catherwood Hormel, a Princeton alum made Spam from leftover hams. Ettore Boiardi game to the US at 16 in Ellis Island. He opened a restaurant in Cleveland, Ohio, Il Giardino d'Italia which was so successful he was barraged with requests for his pasta sauce. He started manufacturing them under the name "Chef Boy-ar-dee."
